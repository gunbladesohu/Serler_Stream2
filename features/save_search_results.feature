# Feature: save the search results
#   As a registered user
#   I want to be able to save any searches I make
#   So that I can easily run them again later to save time

#   Scenario: save search results button
#     Given I am on the advance search page: "http://localhost:3000/search_queries/new"
#     When I click the "Start Search" button
#     # Then It goes to the page of "Search Result"
#     # Then It returns search condition "Method Is equal to Test Driven Development"
#     # When I click the "Save Result" button on the search result page
#     # Then I can see a popup model with "Save Result"

#   Scenario: save search results popup
#     Given I have click "Save Result" button
#     When I write "my results for agile" in the description
#     And I click "Save Result" on the popup model
#     Then it returns a message of "Search results was successfully saved."
#     And I can see a saved results "my results for agile" on the saved reults page:"http://localhost:3000/search_queries/queries_result"
